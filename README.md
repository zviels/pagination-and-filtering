# Pagination & Filtering

A front end project I built for my portfolio during my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). In this project I used a common web development technique called "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

I was given a file that contains information about forty-two students, including names, email addresses and pictures. I then used my JavaScript skills to -

- Display the first nine students on the page.
- Add pagination buttons that the user can click on to display different pages of students.

The app works with a list of any number of students, not just with the supplied array of forty-two students.

## Quick Start

To view the app -

- You can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/zviels/pagination-and-filtering/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it and open `index.html`.
- Alternatively, you can watch the app online [here](https://zviels.github.io/pagination-and-filtering).

## Overview

As mentioned above, I developed this app as part of my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). I participated in their [Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree) program. In this section you can read about -

- The topics I learned before I started developing the app.
- The requirements I had to meet to complete this project.
- Additional features I chose to implement for the app.
- The rating the project received.

### What Did I Learn?

Here is what I learned before I started working on the project -

- CSS Selectors Quickstart <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS%20Course-3659a2" alt="CSS Course">
- JavaScript and the DOM <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JS%20Course-3659a2" alt="JS Course">
- DOM Scripting By Example <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JS%20Course-3659a2" alt="JS Course">

I also learned how to structure my code, debug JS in the browser, write pseudocode and translate it to a valid, working code.

### Project Requirements

### Additional Features

These are features I chose to implement for the project, even though I didn't have to. The additional features may extend the functionality of the app, improve the user experience or beautify the user interface.

As of this moment I have implemented three additional features for the app.

- You don't have to click the search button to get the results back. You will get the search results instantly, while typing in the search bar.
- You can search for a student not only by name, but also by email address or joining date. 
- I also designed a fancy "No Results" message, that clearly shows which search term has no results. The message also includes a sad emoji and text that encourages the user to try searching again. To implement this feature, I had to work with an existing CSS file. I used [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) to achieve this result.

### Rating

There are two possible grades for each Techdegree project - "Meets Expectations" and "Exceeds Expectations".

This project received the **"Exceeds Expectations"** rating.
